I believe in fires at midnight
When the dogs have all been fed.
A golden toddy on the mantle
A broken gun beneath the bed.

Silken mist outside the window.
Frogs and newts slip in the dark
Too much hurry ruins the body.
I'll sit easy, fan the spark

Kindled by the dying embers
Of another working day.
Go upstairs, take off your makeup
Fold your clothes neatly away.
